# Cardiovascular-Risk-Prediction

• The dataset is from an ongoing cadiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Masschusetts. The classification goal
is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patients
information. It includes over 4000 records and 15 attributes. Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic,
behavioral, and medical risk factors.
• The goal of the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is to identify risk factors for cardiovascular disease related to the onset of
coronary heart disease and stroke in adults.

• As with men, women's most common heart attack symptom is chest pain (angina) or discomfort. But women may experience other
symptoms that are typically less associated with heart attack, such as shortness of breath, nausea/vomiting, and back or jaw pain.

education
